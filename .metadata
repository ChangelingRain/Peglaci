  "description" : "A race of peaceful, peace-keeping humanoids from an icy world. A race mod created originaly by Djinn, revived by the community.\n\n[b]Atention:[/b] You need a Race Extender Mod to being able to play the Peglaci. I personally recommend [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733119753]ACCM - Another Character Creation Mod[/url].\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/uLSgt3T.png[/img]\n[i]\"Other races may seek for ages the mystery of their origins. Not so for the Peglaci - we alone know our creators.\"\n\n\"In our distant past, the Peglaci were an apex carnivore, hunting - and being hunted by - the whales that were their chief source of food. They scarcely had tool-use, and gathered themselves in hunting bands, raiding other groups and running off with their young.\"\n\n\"One day, a great light came upon our ancestors, and they felt themselves change inside - the influence of the Giants, our creators and parents to us all. Over scant millenia, the Giants guided our species from savagery into civilization, spurning our worship and instilling in us the knowledge that we could be as them, one day.\"\n\n\"The Giants answered what questions we thought to ask, seemingly proud that we sought to push ourselves forwards, and ever willing to help us advance. They asked nothing of us in return - what could we give a race such as theirs? Even so, we strove to live up to their intentions for us, however murky they may have seemed.\"\n\n\"All at once, they left us. Whether they ascended beyond this realm, having accomplished their goals, or merely died off, we know not. All they left us were their artifacts, their databanks, and their belief in tolerance and justice.\"\n\n\"As Peacekeepers, we strive to make the galaxy a better place for all beings, as they would have wanted.\"[/i] \n\n- Cicatrice White-Glare, Peacekeeper Chief\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/3hkBl6v.png[/img]\n[h1]Peglaci Characters[/h1]\nThe Peglaci are a brand new race ideally suited for cold climates - no longer will you fear the cold, now you will embrace it. \n[list][*][b]Brand New Ship[/b] - Tiny, but terribly efficient. All tech in the ship is concentrated in one area near the captain's chair. The rest of the ship keeps growing with each tier.\n[*][b]Building Stuff[/b] - A selection of peglaci Tiles and Objects to let your imagination fly while building.\n[*][b]Complete Armor Sets[/b] - Armor for every tier of content to keep you warm and comfortable no matter how cold it gets!\n[*][b]Complete Weapon Selection[/b] - Balanced spears, axes, fist weapons, and throwing weapons for every tier! Look for the ranged weapons on the \"Peglaci Gun Crafter\" at the Inventory table, a new station that you can use to craft the distinctive hight tech weapons of the peglaci.\n[*][b]Guns with Alternate Fire[/b] - You start with a small pistol; you'll find that you can either fire it as normal or charge it to fire a bouncing shot. There are a lot of balanced and fun guns that you can craft and, later on, enhance. All of the with their unique alt ability.\n[*][b]Fine Dining[/b] - The Peglaci come with two new crops, that can also be found (rarely) in the wild: Snowberries and Spongeweed.\n[*][b]Vanilla Integration[/b] - The Peglaci have an opinion for almost EVERY VANILLA OBJECT IN THE ENTIRE GAME! No matter whether you're in a Glitch town, a Human prison or an Avian tomb, your character will have something to say about it!\n[*][b]Don't Start as a Total Failure[/b] - Often overlooked as a feature! You start out with a set of Tier 1 armor, a dagger and a broken (easily repairable) gun. You were sent out to do a job, so you're not starting from scratch!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Non-Peglaci Characters[/h1]\nEven if you are not using a peglaci character, you could get some benefits too. This list will grow with time.\n[list][*][b]Building Stuff[/b] - In the Infinity Express, you can buy a crafting database to learn every peglaci blueprint. This is a placeholder location as, in the future, you will be able to buy it in an outpost-like world, exclusive from a peglaci questline.\n[*][b]Peglaci Tenants[/b] - They don't have all his dialogue lines yet, but you can build houses to host tenants of your favorite goat-like space race.\n[/list]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/znyXXip.png[/img]\nMost mods should works just fine alongside this one. The Peglaci only adds new content, and modify little to no vanilla files. However, here we will list any possible problem with another mod, and also list mods that synergize well with this one.\n[list]\n[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149]Frackin Universe[/url][/b]:\n[list][*]The custom races didn't work well with FU BYOS. Please, install the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1194878261]FU BYOS Modded Race Support[/url] patch to solve that problem.\n[*]FU also gives the player acces to the three old legacy Peglaci tiles.\n[*]Some weapons from FU may look similar, as they used some of the old peglaci weapon sprites.\n[*]Give the player acces to the Update Windows Info. A small window will Pop-up on every major Peglaci update.\n[/list]\n[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763259329]Frackin Races[/url][/b] - It adds racial abilities to the Peglaci.\n[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1465571894]Ztarbound[/url][/b] - Give the player acces to the Update Windows Info. A small window will Pop-up on every major Peglaci update. This mod is integrated into FU.\n[/list]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/3n1SaWo.png[/img]\nCheck our Discord server, there is always someone roaming around:\nhttps://discord.gg/QxDVQjt\n\nFeeling reckless? You can also download the Dev Build of the mod from our Github Server:\nhttps://github.com/Unknown-Anomaly/Peglaci\n\n[b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] The Dev Build may be broken, or may broke your game, download it at your own risk.\n\nThis mod is revived for the community, to the community. That means that everyone can help! Lore, Art, Scripts, Buildings, Ideas, etc. Anyone can contribute with the mod. This is a list of examples of some of the positions that you can fill if you want to help us:[list]\n [*][b]Programmer[/b] - If you know LUA, JSON and how Starbound interact with its files, you can do a lot of things.\n [*][b]Pixel Artist[/b] - Because without new assets, the amount of things we can do are limited.\n [*][b]Concept Artist[/b] - Designing new assets, effects, weapons, abilities, etc. It's a lot easier with a visual reference. Even lore writing could benefit from it!\n [*][b]Lore Maker[/b] - The amount of lore left by Djinn it's limited. To expand in missions and history, we will need some lore as a context, and as codex entries.\n [*][b]Map Maker[/b] - Missions, encounters, dungeons, microdungeons, villages. We need people that can build cool things... and if the can learn how to use Tiled, is even better!\n [*][b]Mission Designer[/b] - Building a cool structure is one thing, but create a coherent, good looking and balanced mission, it's another. Know how to use Tiled is not a must, but is a very good plus.\n [*][b]Beta Tester[/b] - Because someone has to test the crazy things. =P\n [*][b]And much more![/b] - You don't need to fill one particular role or be very involved to help. Any small suggestion or bug report it's really helpful, even just talk with others about the mod.[/list]",

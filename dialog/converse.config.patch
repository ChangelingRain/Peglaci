      "I hear there's a Peacekeeper Stationhouse somewhere nearby - all distress calls get routed through there so you can dispatch help.",
      "Aren't you hot under all those clothes - and all that fur?",
      "I hope you don't look down on us for our beliefs.",
      "I met one of your kind years ago - they were very tolerant and wise.",
      "Gods, creators, what's the difference?",
      "What's wrong with our religion, huh?",
      "I've been to one of your outposts - by Kluex, you keep it cold in there.",
      "I think the Peglaci are alright, despite what they say about us.",
      "I've heard tell of Peglaci Cannibals out in the asteroid fields - they're a scary bunch. Certainly not interested in peace.",
      "What's the use of peace, anyhow? A little uncertainty is exciting.",
      "Kluex will forgive you your disbelief.",
      "Your fur looks very warm and cozy - the chill must not get to you at all.",
      "I've heard that Peglaci cuisine is terrible, but I'm still anxious to try it one day."

# Dialogs
These are the responses of different NPC (tenants, villagers, guards, etc.) when the player interact with them. In this document, you can write or edit the responses of Peglaci NPCs to any player, and the responses of NPCs from different races, to a Peglaci player. You can see examples of those, in the folder "dialog" of the assets of the game.

## Peglaci Guard

* "Move along, I am currently busy with my duty."
* "I'm keeping an eye on you, better not cause any fuss."
* "The cold is not for the weak, thus I'm not weak."
* "Cause trouble? I'l smash you in."
* "Watch yourself."
* "I'm busy, not now."
* "Don't even think about it."
